Excellent job in many ways. I Liked that you put care into the user experience. I also liked all the comments and docstrings in your functions.

Here are some things to consider:

2.1 -- You report a bad number but still let the program continue. Better would be to have a loop that asks the user to try again.

while True:

   try():

      ...

      break


2.3 -- Along with the above advice... 

You didn't need the backslash because of the parenthesis. This works fine:

print("\nThis program will read a measurement in feet from the console and "

      "convert the result to meters and display the result.\n")



2.5 -- It's generally best to put your functions at the top / above the body code for readability.

Another thing, since you like \n, you could instead print triple quote blocks, which honor the new lines.

'''Line 1

Line 2

Line 3'''



3.1 & 3.5 - Nice job except you did slightly go over the 80 character limit. That throws an exception in my PEP8 checker.

The only other issues were covered above.
