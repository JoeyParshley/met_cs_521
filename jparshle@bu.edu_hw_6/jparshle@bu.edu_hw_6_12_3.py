   Description: Use the Account class created in Exercise 7.3 to simulate an 
                ATM machine. Create ten accounts in a list with the ids 
                0 , 1 , ..., 9 , and an initial balance of $100. The system 
                prompts the user to enter an id. If the id is entered 
                incorrectly, ask the user to enter a correct id. Once an id is 
                accepted, the main menu is displayed as shown in the sample 
                run. You can enter a choice of 1 for viewing the current 
                balance, 2 for withdrawing money, 3 for depositing money, 
                and 4 for exiting the main menu. Once you exit, the system will 
                prompt for an id again. So, once the system starts, it 
                wonâ€™t stop.
