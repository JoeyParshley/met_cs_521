Nice job. You clearly have programming experience.

Please read my comments carefully because some of your style elements will lead to deductions going forward.

For #1.3, here is a more compact answer:

print("""
FFFFFFF  U     U  NN    NN
FF       U     U  NNN   NN
FFFFFFF  U     U  NN N  NN
FF        U   U   NN  N NN
FF         UUU    NN   NNN
""")

In the future, be sure to use functions for repeat operations (like for 1.11). 

You should not EVER mix spaces and tabs in Python. Very dangerous.

Your code just used tabs in the docstrings, so not bad - but you if you are in the habit, you might accidentally do it in code.

Please just use spaces going forward.

Nice job using the docstrings. But now remember to add lots of # comments in your code.

Next, please keep your lines under 80 characters. The PEP8 standard describes this and other best practices that I'll be mentioning during the semester.

Finally, instead of printing with % or just commas that leave text unformatted, use the fuction format(). 

It's a lot more powerful.  For example:

print("Total population after 2 years will be: {0:,.2f}".format(pop))

The above will add commas and two decimal places.
