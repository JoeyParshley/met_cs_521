   Description: program so that it finds the two points in a three-dimensional
   space nearest to each other. Use a two-dimensional list to represent the
   points. Test the program using the following points:

   points = [
        [-1, 0, 3],
        [-1, -1, -1],
        [4, 1, 1],
        [2, 0.5, 9],
        [3.5, 2, -1],
        [3, 1.5, 3],
        [-1.5, 4, 2],
        [5.5, 4, -0.5]
    ]

    formula for computing distance between two points in 3 dimensional space:
    (x1, x2, x3) and (x2, y2, z2)

    dist =  √( (x2−x1)^2+(y2−y1)^2+(z2−z1)^2)
