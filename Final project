Dear CS-521 students:

 Additional Information for CS-521:

The term project and video will be due by Friday, April 27 at 11:59pm. We recommend students try to finish sooner
Students should record their presentation using Kaltura, and then upload it into an already built assignment in blackboard.
We have clear instructions on this for students, and this will make it very simple for facilitator grading. It will be delivered into the grade center for grading like a normal deliverable.
 

You submit the following for your final project:

(zipped) file with your code and 1-2 page description
video recording using “kaltura”
Here is some info on how Kaltura works: https://onlinecampus.bu.edu/bbcswebdav/courses/00cwr_odeelements/cfa/cfa_Kaltura.htm

This is a Python project. We want to see (at the minimum) the use of the following

(1) collections (at least one): list, set, tuple or dictionary)

(2) flow constructs (at least one) - if/else  or while

(3) file access

(4) at least one class (could be very simple)

(5) (at least one) function(s)

(6) documentation (docstring for every function and class)

We need to be able to run your code ourselves, if needed.
